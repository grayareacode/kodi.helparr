- Radarr and/or Sonarr already installed and setup.

## Configuration
Open the add-on from the Addons menu, choose **Settings**, and enter your Radarr/Sonarr URLs and API keys. Defaults are `http://localhost:7878` for Radarr and `http://localhost:8989` for Sonarr, but any reachable host will work.

You can find your Radarr and Sonnar API keys from the webui in Radarr and Sonarr, **Settings->General->API Key**.
